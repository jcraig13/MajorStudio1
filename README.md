This is the repository for the class, Major Studio 1. This class is a first semester studio for the Master's program in Data Visualization. This semester, our class collaborated with the Smithsonian Open Access Database. With this oppurtunity, I completed a lot of research and exploration of their museums.
I took a liking to the Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum and used thei dataset for all of my projects.

Included in this repository is our first assignment, find quantitative data and visualize it. I chose a project about natural vs synthetic plastics and do a deep dive of the materials used at the Cooper Hewitt.

Our final project for this class was to create an interactive project. I decided to redesign my quantitative project and create a more editorial informational site for it. I wanted to redesign the colors, composition, symbolism, and typography.
