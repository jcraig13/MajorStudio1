This is a sketch of how I would use data from the National Portrait Gallery Collection to analyze what percentage of each type of portrait there is. The types of portrait I am looking at are regular portraits, 2 person portraits, group portraits, self portraits, and unknown portraits.

Sketch for "History of Pleated Fans"

This sketch takes a look at the evolution of women's accessories. It is interesting to see where and when pleated fans were popular/used. The materials are very interesting to look at while considering who was using these fans. After 1720, fans were more accessible, does this mean that the materials/quality changed?

Sketch for "The Use of Natural Plastics"

Before there were petroleum based plastics, animals were used for their material. Tortoiseshell, horn, and leather were used to made combs, boxes, etc. These materials were overconsumed and people became a threat to their species. After switching to synthetic plastics such as: nylon, polyester, styrofoam, and acetate, the overconsumption continued. However, this posed an even greater threat to the environment.
