### Original concept sketches:
Sketch for "Who's Portrait?"

This is a sketch of how I would use data from the National Portrait Gallery Collection to analyze what percentage of each type of portrait there is. The types of portrait I am looking at are regular portraits, 2 person portraits, group portraits, self portraits, and unknown portraits.

Sketch for "History of Pleated Fans"

This sketch takes a look at the evolution of women's accessories. It is interesting to see where and when pleated fans were popular/used. The materials are very interesting to look at while considering who was using these fans. After 1720, fans were more accessible, does this mean that the materials/quality changed?

Sketch for "The Use of Natural Plastics"

Before there were petroleum based plastics, animals were used for their material. Tortoiseshell, horn, and leather were used to made combs, boxes, etc. These materials were overconsumed and people became a threat to their species. After switching to synthetic plastics such as: nylon, polyester, styrofoam, and acetate, the overconsumption continued. However, this posed an even greater threat to the environment.

### High fidelity concepts
After deciding on the argument: "the use of natural plastics" I created a mockup in figma

In these mock ups, the design on the left shows equal sized stacked bars representing the transition of material over time. On the right, it shows equal sized bars, but more as a population pyramid. After recieving feedback from classmates, I decided on doing a sort of combination of the charts. For example, it would be represented as a pop. pyramid while showing the different materials represented.

## Process
### Gathering data
I used the Smithsonian database and defined my search criteria. I wanted to look specifically into the Cooper Hewitt Design Museum. I wanted to use three natural materials (tortoiseshell, ivory, and leather) and three synthetic materials (plastic, nylon, and polyester).

One by one I searched each individual material and tallied how many were present in each year. This is an example of my dataset in excel

I created the column % of each material because origionally I wanted the material distribution to be relative to the year. During produciton, the concept did not convey the information in an effective way. So I decided to show the consumption of material as a whole over time until present day.

### D3
Creating the data set was the most time consuming, finding the right filters and tallying the years. After this was all done, I turned to examples of population pyramids for help with my actual project. My source was: https://doylek.github.io/D3-Population-Pyramid/ 

### This is a screenshot from my final project

## What I can improve on
I believe working on aesthetics of the visualization would help with the story of this project. I think I can work on how the images are incorporated into the visualization, not just an add on. I also would like to play more with the layout of the population pyramid (i.e. possible play with orientation, stacking of materials, or changing the intervals used to show the information (less bars)).
