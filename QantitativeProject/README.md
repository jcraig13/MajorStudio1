# Natural vs. Synthetic Plastic
## An analysis of design materials use over time at the Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum

## Research
I was inspired by the Cooper-Hewittâ€™s exhibition of natural plastics.

https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/exhibitions/1159161445/

The natural materials mentioned were used as a plastic material. These materials were overconsumed and people became a threat to their species. After switching to synthetic plastics such as: nylon, polyester, styrofoam, and acetate, the overconsumption continued. However, this posed an even greater threat to the environment.

The question is: can there ethically be plastic, natural or synthetic?


## Sketches and Prototypes

It was hard to make a choice whether to make the data proportional or not. The color palatte was also a challenging decision to make.

## Process

I researched how to make a population chart and found this great source: https://doylek.github.io/D3-Population-Pyramid/

The tech used: Excel, javascript, d3, HTML, CSS, jQuery, Figma

First, I counted each entry found for each material at the Cooper Hewitt. I tallied them by decade and added them in Excel. This is how I gathered my data for the population pyramid.

I categorized the data by whether or not they were natural or synthetic plastics.

## Final Product

The final site can be found here: https://jcraig13.github.io/MajorStudio1/QantitativeProject/

## Future of This Project

In the future, I think this project can use some designed features. There is some missing details and information that could be included to be helpful to more audiences. The design of this site is underwhelming to me, but the data is very interesting.
