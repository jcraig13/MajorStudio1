# Interactive Natural vs Synthetic Plastic Project

## Initial Steps
I took my Quantitaive project from this semester and redesigned it to be more interactive. 

This is my origional project design

After recieving feedback from professors and classmates, I decided this topic was important enough to need a stronger design. I was really determined to create a more interactive project for this topic.

My initial sketch looked something like this:

I likes these opposing colors and options to render the bar graphs, but there was still something missing. I took inspiration from the book, "Say Goodbye to Plastic" cover design. THis book is about that is about the epidemic of plastic use and solutions for a plastic-free future.

The second interation of sketches I have look like this:

Ultimatley, I wanted to add a story telling element and a breakdown of charts for information. This project's main goal is to go into detail about the materials (what they are, how theyâ€™re used). I quickly realized during the presentation of my last project, there was a huge lack of information. I had assumed my audience knew much more than they did.

## Process
Tech Used: HTML, CSS, d3.js, jquery, Excel

Info Source: collections.si.edu, Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum

Charts Used: stacked bar graph, population pyramid


## Final Iteration
Here are some screenshots of my final product:

Using a snap scroll style, I forced the viewer to learn about the topic before getting into the data.

## Future
In the future, I can see this project including more materials, including bio-plastics. I think it would also be worth looking into how long each material takes to decompose as well as studying how much energy it costs to create each material.
